            The USA are one of the most business friendly countries in the world. You can setup your business fully remotely, also
            as a Non-Resident. This means that not even a travel to the States is needed to incorporate a company and to open a
            bank account.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can help you to incorporate an LLC or INC in every 50 states across the US. Also, we take care of your book-keeping
            and will submit all necessary reports to the IRS. Before doing so, we strongly recommend a consultation with an expert
            to see what tax advantages you might gain and if your concept is compliant with the Double Taxation Treaty. Failing so
            could lead into serious legal problems and cause a lot of unnecessary costs.
